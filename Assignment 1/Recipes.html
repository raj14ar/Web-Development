                I adapted this recipe from a book called <i>Sydney Food</i> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross, Sydney. I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the best scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.
